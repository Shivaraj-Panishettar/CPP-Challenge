# 🚀 120 Days of C++ Coding Challenge

Welcome to my **120 Days of C++ Coding** and **60 Days of Project** challenge! This repository will document my journey as I progress through various levels of C++ mastery.

## 📝 Challenge Overview

The challenge is split into two phases:

1. **120 Days of C++ Coding**:
    - 🛠️ Focus on learning and practicing fundamental to advanced C++ concepts.
    - 📚 Each week tackles a new aspect of C++ programming, covering topics like object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, and more.
    
2. **60 Days of Project**:
    - 💻 Put the theory into practice by working on real-world C++ projects.
    - 🔧 Create both mini and large-scale applications, improving problem-solving and coding skills.
